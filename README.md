It's a two player game. First user has to start the game to select the boxes and then it indicates which players turn. Once all turns are complete it indicates match status.

Using Reset Game button - user can start the game from scratch.

History table on the right shows points for each round

### Additional Feature:

Offline and Online Support: If a backend server is available, upon every grid selection, the app makes an API call to the backend and fetches the result from there, storing the result.

Functionality wise its complete. It  handles duplicate logic as well.

Yet to implement features:
* Start game button
* Once game over backspace/enter should not work
* Game History
* Need to write few functions in more optimised way
* Check entered word is a valid word or not
